executing new Microservice based infrastructures for our customers. We deliver from scratch technology and phased 
legacy migrations that are focused on delivering business goals at a rapid pace utilizing our proprietary Microservice 
framework.
 Designed, Implemented and Managed the consolidation of 3 internal, disparate products down to one 
cohesive product. The focus of the product was the delivery of simplified IoT access on Azure. We leveraged

Azure, and Angular. Built on the Fathym Microservices architecture, these applications are brought to life in rapid 
timelines with great flexibility and growth opportunities.
 Converted Enterprise Technology to Open-Source repositories on GitHub. This included the conversion of a 
JQuery MVC app to the latest Angular, and the push of several different micro-applications built on 
Angular/SignalR/Azure architecture. 
 Migrated away from a disparate architecture to cohesive cloud architecture to improve the speed of dev 
cycles, simplify the complexity of the products, and shed some of the heavier APIs in favor of Serverless 
approaches.
 Designed, Configured, and Implemented DevOps practices across a team of 15 developers. The DevOps 
setup covered front-end angular/react, Infrastructure as Code deployments, c# based APIs/Apps/Functions, and

 Migrated Application Infrastructure to Azure Hosting to leverage scalability features and to replace outdated 
hardware. Leveraged many of Azure’s latest technologies including: DocumentDB, Azure Search, SQL Azure, 
Cloud Services, Azure Cache and more. 
 Designed, Organized, and Implemented a new API stack focused on migrating the team to a Micorservice 
Oriented Architecture without disrupting feature delivery and with minimal changes to User Interfaces. Shifted 
from a single API covering all business domains, to silos for each individual domain that are connected via 
reporting services and consuming application interfaces.
 Served as Product Owner for Architectural Backlog creating stories for Azure migration, system administration 
& maintenance planning, and internal user interfaces for managing development operations. These user interfaces 
included dashboards for visualizing server performance, remotely controlling service/server lifecycle, and managing 
survey operations.
 Rewrote the Carrier Integrations architecture for SMS to C# to position the company in a place where all 
developers could help in developing integrations, instead of a single Java resource. Utilized WCF to create a 
protocol agnostic solution that allows support for HTTP, SOAP, and SMPP based integrations from a single 
internal contract.
 Reorganized the Agile (SCRUM) Process to more effectively plan, track, and deliver on software deadlines. 
Implemented more structured daily scrums, bi-weekly sprint planning meetings, and a series of management 
meetings geared at improving the quality of team backlogs.

and managing priority of work to accomplish advancements in service architecture, release management, and 
AGILE process improvement. This work was leveraged by realization teams to efficiently accomplish the core 
product roadmap.
 Release Manager for 25+ application interfaces and 30+ core assemblies where I was responsible for 
managing all source control for feature integration & software releases, and controlled the approval process for 
determining when each feature would be introduced into product releases.
 Designed and implemented automation strategy for quality assurance and release management in order to 
improve development process efficiency and support simultaneous feature development.

“copy-paste” code re-use. Was met with resistance from upper management, but after some prototyping and 
performance testing (which yielded drastic improvements) was able to get the project approved for a full refactoring effort of all business critical code.
 Maintained and improved the mobile messaging platform utilizing SMPP protocol via the OpenMarket SMS 
Aggregator
 Lead initiative to upgrade Web Services to WCF Services in order to take advantage of extensibility (for multilingual service support), configurability, and overall maintainability.
